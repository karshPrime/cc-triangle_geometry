# Triangle Geometry
### League Challenge 1

Your task is to create a program that will take inputs of three 2-dimensional coordinates (x and y)
and then output varying levels of information based on it.

Easy: Using the three 2-D points, print out the distances of the line segments that make up the
triangle formed by said points.

Medium: Describe which kind of triangle is formed, based on both interior angles and side lengths.

Hard: Graphically display the triangle (ideally on a Cartesian x/y axis, but not mandatory) and also
give the total perimeter of the triangle as well as its surface area.

The inputs will be given as a file containing 10 sets of the three 2-D points, so 10 triangles
total. Your program will need to read this file and perform the above for each triangle i.e. no
hardcoding the values.

To find some test data to work with, use the following link and copy/paste the output to a file of
your choosing: https://replit.com/@lachlansmith/SimilarAdmiredRuntimes
